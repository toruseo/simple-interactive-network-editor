# SINE: Simple Interactive Network Editor

https://toruseo.jp/simple-interactive-network-editor/

This is a web browser-based editor for networks (more precisely, directed graphs).
You can place nodes and links intuitively and export the network as JSON.

Primarily made by Claude 3 Opus (they named it too), under supervision of [Toru Seo](https://toruseo.jp/index_en.html) with help of GitHub Copilot.
